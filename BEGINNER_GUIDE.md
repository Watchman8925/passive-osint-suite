## üîç **STEP 5: YOUR FIRST INVESTIGATION**

### **Using the Web Interface (Recommended for Beginners)**

#### **1. Cross-Reference Intelligence (Finding Information)**

1. Click on **"Cross-Reference Intelligence"** tile
2. Enter a name, company, or topic you want to research
3. Click **"Start Investigation"**
4. Watch as the system searches:
   - WikiLeaks documents
   - Panama Papers
   - Paradise Papers
   - Pandora Papers
   - Archive.org
   - And 8+ other leak databases
5. Results appear in real-time!

#### **2. Pattern Detection (Finding Hidden Connections)**

1. Click on **"Pattern Detection"** tile
2. Enter multiple pieces of information (one per line):
   - Names
   - Companies
   - Dates
   - Locations
   - Events
3. Click **"Analyze Patterns"**
4. System will find hidden connections you might miss!

#### **3. Conspiracy Theory Validation**

1. Click on **"Conspiracy Analysis"** tile
2. Describe a theory or claim you want to check
3. The system will:
   - Find supporting evidence
   - Find contradicting evidence
   - Calculate probability of truth
   - Show expert analysis
   - Suggest alternative explanations

### **Using the Command Line Interface**

If you prefer the text interface:

#### **From the Main Menu:**

- Type `2` for Cross-Reference Intelligence
- Type `3` for Pattern Detection  
- Type `4` for Conspiracy Analysis
- Type `6` for Email Investigation
- Type `7` for Domain Investigation
- Type `8` for Company Investigation

---

## üìä **UNDERSTANDING YOUR RESULTS**

### **Cross-Reference Results**

- **Confidence Score**: 0.0-1.0 (higher = more reliable)
- **Relevance Score**: 0.0-1.0 (higher = more related to your search)
- **Source**: Which database found the information
- **Title**: Summary of what was found
- **URL**: Link to original document (if available)

### **Pattern Detection Results**

- **Pattern Type**: Kind of connection found
- **Confidence**: How sure the system is
- **Truth Probability**: Likelihood this is real
- **Significance**: How important this pattern is
- **Evidence**: Supporting information

### **Conspiracy Analysis Results**

- **Truth Probability**: 0-100% chance theory is correct
- **Confidence Level**: How sure the analysis is
- **Evidence Summary**: What supports/contradicts
- **Expert Consensus**: What experts would likely say
- **Alternative Explanations**: Other possible explanations

---

## üîí **STAYING SAFE AND ANONYMOUS**

### **Built-in Privacy Protection**

This system automatically:

- **Routes all traffic through Tor** (anonymous browsing)
- **Encrypts all data** you save
- **Processes everything locally** (nothing sent to external AI services)
- **Scrubs metadata** from files
- **Uses anonymous identities** for web requests

### **Additional Safety Tips**

1. **Never investigate yourself** or people you know personally
2. **Use VPN** in addition to built-in Tor
3. **Don't save sensitive results** on cloud storage
4. **Clear browser history** after investigations
5. **Use dedicated computer** for sensitive investigations

---

## üÜò **TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON PROBLEMS**

### **"Command not found" Error**

- **Problem**: Python or Git not installed correctly
- **Solution**: Reinstall Python/Git and check "Add to PATH"

### **"Permission denied" Error**

- **Windows**: Run Command Prompt as Administrator
- **Mac/Linux**: Add `sudo` before commands (e.g., `sudo pip install...`)

### **"Port already in use" Error**

- **Problem**: Another program using port 3000
- **Solution**: Close the program or restart your computer

### **"Module not found" Error**

- **Problem**: Missing Python dependencies
- **Solution**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

### **Web interface won't load**

1. Make sure you typed `localhost:3000` correctly
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for server to start
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check if any firewall is blocking it

### **Slow performance**

1. Close other programs
2. Use fewer search terms
3. Search one database at a time
4. Restart the program
