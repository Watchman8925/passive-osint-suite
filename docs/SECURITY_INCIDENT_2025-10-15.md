# Security Incident Report: Committed Private Key

**Date**: 2025-10-15  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: RESOLVED

## Incident Summary

A private Ed25519 signing key was discovered committed to the repository at `config/audit_ed25519_key.pem`. This key is used by the audit trail system to cryptographically sign all OSINT operations, providing tamper-evident logging.

## Impact Assessment

### Compromised Assets
- **File**: `config/audit_ed25519_key.pem`
- **Key Type**: Ed25519 private key
- **Purpose**: Audit trail cryptographic signatures
- **First Committed**: Commit `fe3be9e` (exact date to be determined from git history)
- **Exposure**: Public (committed to GitHub repository)

### Security Implications
1. **Audit Trail Integrity**: Any party with access to the private key could forge audit signatures
2. **Non-repudiation Compromised**: Cannot trust the authenticity of historical audit records signed with this key
3. **Compliance Issues**: Violates security best practices and may impact compliance certifications

### Affected Systems
- Audit trail logging system (`security/audit_trail.py`)
- All operations that generate cryptographically signed audit logs
- Forensic and compliance reporting features

## Remediation Actions Taken

### Immediate Response (Completed)

1. ✅ **Removed Private Key from Working Directory**
   - Deleted `config/audit_ed25519_key.pem` from current branch
   - File will be removed from git history in separate cleanup step

2. ✅ **Updated .gitignore**
   - Added patterns to prevent future commits of private keys:
     - `*.pem`
     - `*.key`
     - `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `*.jks` (other certificate formats)
     - `config/*key*.pem` and `config/*key*.key` (specific patterns)

3. ✅ **Enhanced Key Management**
   - Modified `security/audit_trail.py` to support loading keys from environment variables
   - Priority order: Environment variable → File → Generate new
   - Added `AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY` environment variable support (base64-encoded PEM)

4. ✅ **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated `.env.example` with secure key generation instructions
   - Added this security incident report

### Required Follow-up Actions

⚠️ **Critical**: The following actions must be performed by repository administrators:

1. **Remove Key from Git History**
   ```bash
   # Using git-filter-repo (recommended)
   git filter-repo --path config/audit_ed25519_key.pem --invert-paths
   
   # OR using BFG Repo-Cleaner
   bfg --delete-files audit_ed25519_key.pem
   git reflog expire --expire=now --all
   git gc --prune=now --aggressive
   
   # Force push to all branches
   git push origin --force --all
   git push origin --force --tags
   ```

2. **Generate New Signing Key**
   ```bash
   # Generate new Ed25519 key pair
   python3 << 'EOF'
   from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ed25519
   from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization
   import base64
   
   # Generate new key
   key = ed25519.Ed25519PrivateKey.generate()
   
   # Export as base64-encoded PEM for environment variable
   pem_bytes = key.private_bytes(
       encoding=serialization.Encoding.PEM,
       format=serialization.PrivateFormat.PKCS8,
       encryption_algorithm=serialization.NoEncryption()
   )
   encoded_key = base64.b64encode(pem_bytes).decode()
   
   print("=== New Audit Signing Key (base64-encoded PEM) ===")
   print(encoded_key)
   print("\n=== Add to .env or secret manager ===")
   print(f"AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY={encoded_key}")
   
   # Also save public key for distribution
   public_pem = key.public_key().public_bytes(
       encoding=serialization.Encoding.PEM,
       format=serialization.PublicFormat.SubjectPublicKeyInfo
   )
   print("\n=== Public Key (can be shared) ===")
   print(public_pem.decode())
   EOF
   ```

3. **Store Key Securely**
   - **Production**: Use a secret manager (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault)
   - **Development**: Add to `.env` file (never commit this file)
   - **CI/CD**: Store as encrypted secret in GitHub Actions/CI system

4. **Invalidate Historical Audit Records**
   - Review all audit logs signed with the compromised key
   - Mark them as "potentially compromised" in documentation
   - Consider re-signing critical audit records with the new key if original data is verified

5. **Notify Stakeholders**
   - Security team
   - Compliance officers
   - Users who rely on audit trail integrity
   - Any third parties who may have depended on cryptographic signatures

## Prevention Measures Implemented

1. **Pre-commit Hooks** (Recommended to add)
   ```yaml
   # Add to .pre-commit-config.yaml
   - repo: https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets
     rev: v1.4.0
     hooks:
       - id: detect-secrets
   ```

2. **Repository Scanning**
   - Enable GitHub secret scanning alerts
   - Enable Dependabot security alerts
   - Consider periodic security audits with tools like `git-secrets` or `truffleHog`

3. **Documentation**
   - Security best practices documented in code comments
   - Environment variable usage documented in `.env.example`
   - This incident report serves as historical record

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never commit private keys**: Even to private repositories, as they may become public
2. **Use environment variables**: For all secrets and cryptographic material
3. **Implement pre-commit hooks**: To catch secrets before they're committed
4. **Regular security audits**: Scan repository for sensitive data periodically
5. **Secret rotation**: Implement key rotation policies for all cryptographic material
