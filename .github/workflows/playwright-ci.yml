# HOW TO ENABLE THIS WORKFLOW:
#
# 1. Option A: Remove job-level 'if: false' conditions
#    - Edit this file and remove lines with 'if: false'
#
# 2. Option B: Use repository variable
#    - Go to repository Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Variables
#    - Create variable ENABLE_PLAYWRIGHT_TESTS with value 'true'
#    - Update job conditions to check this variable
#
# 3. Set up Playwright tests:
#    - cd web
#    - npm install -D @playwright/test
#    - npx playwright install
#    - Create playwright.config.ts
#    - Add test files in web/tests/e2e/
#
# 4. Example playwright.config.ts:
#    ```typescript
#    import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';
#    
#    export default defineConfig({
#      testDir: './tests/e2e',
#      fullyParallel: true,
#      forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
#      retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
#      workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
#      reporter: 'html',
#      use: {
#        baseURL: process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000',
#        trace: 'on-first-retry',
#      },
#      projects: [
#        { name: 'chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } },
#        { name: 'firefox', use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] } },
#        { name: 'webkit', use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] } },
#      ],
#    });
#    ```
#
# 5. Example test file (web/tests/e2e/home.spec.ts):
#    ```typescript
#    import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
#    
#    test('homepage loads', async ({ page }) => {
#      await page.goto('/');
#      await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Passive OSINT Suite/);
#    });
#    ```
