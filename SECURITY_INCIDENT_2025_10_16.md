# Security Incident Report: Committed Private Key

## Date
2025-10-16

## Incident
An Ed25519 private key was accidentally committed to the repository at `config/audit_ed25519_key.pem`.

## Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Key Type**: Ed25519 audit signing key
- **Exposure Duration**: Unknown (key was in repository history)
- **Usage**: The key was NOT actively used by the application. The audit trail system generates its own keys at runtime in `logs/audit/audit_signing_key.pem`
- **Actual Risk**: Low - the committed key was not actually loaded or used by any code path

## Remediation Actions Taken

### 1. Key Removal
- Removed `config/audit_ed25519_key.pem` from the repository
- Added patterns to `.gitignore` to prevent future commits:
  - `**/audit_signing_key.pem`
  - `**/audit_public_key.pem`
  - `**/audit_ed25519_key.pem`
  - `config/*.pem`
  - `config/*.key`

### 2. Code Review
- Verified that the committed key was never referenced in code
- Confirmed that `security/audit_trail.py` generates keys at runtime
- No code changes required as the system already uses secure key generation

### 3. Best Practices Implemented
- All cryptographic keys are now generated at runtime
- Keys are stored in directories excluded from version control
- Documentation updated to reflect secure key management practices

## Key Generation Process
The audit trail system now:
1. Generates Ed25519 key pairs on first run
2. Stores private keys in `logs/audit/audit_signing_key.pem`
3. Stores public keys in `logs/audit/audit_public_key.pem`
4. Uses environment variables for any external key material
5. Never commits keys to version control

## Prevention Measures
- Added comprehensive `.gitignore` patterns for all key file types
- Pre-commit hooks should be used to scan for sensitive data
- Regular security audits should be conducted
- Code review should check for hardcoded secrets

## Recommendations
1. Use secret management systems (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) for production
2. Rotate any keys that may have been derived from this incident
3. Monitor for unauthorized use of the exposed key (though risk is minimal)
4. Consider using `git-filter-repo` or BFG to remove key from git history if desired

## Conclusion
The incident has been remediated with minimal risk exposure. The committed key was never used by the application, and preventive measures are now in place to avoid similar incidents.
