## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### Reporting Process

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues through one of the following channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/Watchman8925/passive-osint-suite/security/advisories)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details

2. **Email**
   - Send details to [security contact - to be configured]
   - Use PGP encryption if possible (key available upon request)
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line

3. **Private Disclosure via Issue**
   - Tag @Watchman8925 directly if needed
   - Mark as confidential if available

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What an attacker could achieve
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have a recommendation
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the issue
- **Your Contact Info**: So we can follow up with questions

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 7-14 days
  - Medium: 14-30 days
  - Low: 30-90 days

We will keep you informed throughout the process and credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

The Passive OSINT Suite includes several security features:

1. **No Hardcoded Secrets**
   - All credentials via environment variables
   - Vault integration for secure storage
   - See [docs/vault_integration.md](docs/vault_integration.md)

2. **Input Validation**
   - XSS prevention
   - SQL injection protection
   - Command injection prevention
   - See `src/passive_osint_common/safety.py`

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - DDoS protection on all endpoints
   - Automatic backoff and retry
   - Configurable rate limits

4. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Secure session management

5. **Audit Trail**
   - Cryptographic signatures (Ed25519)
   - Immutable audit logs
   - OPSEC policy enforcement

6. **Network Security**
   - All operations via Tor (optional)
   - DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) support
   - TLS/HTTPS for external APIs

### Automated Security Scanning

We run automated security scans on every commit:

- **Secret Scanning**: Gitleaks and TruffleHog
- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety and npm audit
- **Code Scanning**: CodeQL analysis
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy for Docker images
- **SAST**: Static analysis security testing

See `.github/workflows/` for CI/CD security workflows.

## Secure Development Practices

### For Contributors

When contributing code:

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Use environment variables
   - Use `.env.example` as template
   - Add sensitive files to `.gitignore`

2. **Use safety helpers**
   - Always use `safe_request` from `src.passive_osint_common.safety`
   - Add input validation with `@input_validation` decorator
   - Handle exceptions with `@handle_exceptions` decorator

3. **Validate all inputs**
   - User inputs
   - API responses
   - File contents
   - Database queries

4. **Follow secure coding guidelines**
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Defense in depth
   - Fail securely
   - Don't trust user input

5. **Run security checks locally**
   ```bash
   # Install security tools
   pip install safety bandit
   
   # Check dependencies
   safety check
   
   # Security linting
   bandit -r modules/ src/
   
   # Run tests
   pytest tests/test_security_integration.py
   ```

### Code Review Checklist

Before merging PRs, verify:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] Output encoding to prevent XSS
- [ ] Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- [ ] Proper error handling without information leakage
- [ ] Timeouts on all network requests
- [ ] Rate limiting where applicable
- [ ] Security tests included
- [ ] Dependencies up-to-date and scanned

## Vault Integration

### Using HashiCorp Vault

For secure credential storage, we recommend HashiCorp Vault:

```python
from src.passive_osint_common.vault_client import VaultClient

# Initialize Vault client
vault = VaultClient()

# Store API key
vault.write_secret("passive-osint/api-keys/shodan", {
    "api_key": "your-key-here"
})

# Retrieve API key
secret = vault.read_secret("passive-osint/api-keys/shodan")
api_key = secret["api_key"]
```

See [docs/vault_integration.md](docs/vault_integration.md) for complete setup guide.

### Environment Variables

If not using Vault, use environment variables:

```bash
# .env file (add to .gitignore!)
SHODAN_API_KEY=your-key-here
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your-key-here
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your-password-here
```

```python
import os

# In code
api_key = os.getenv("SHODAN_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("SHODAN_API_KEY not set in environment")
```

### Credential Rotation

Rotate credentials regularly:

- **API Keys**: Every 90 days
- **Passwords**: Every 90 days
- **Tokens**: Based on expiration policy
- **Certificates**: Before expiration

See [docs/vault_integration.md#rotation-policies](docs/vault_integration.md#rotation-policies) for automation.

## Handling Security Incidents

### If You Discover a Secret in Git History

1. **Immediately rotate the credential**
   - Change the password/key/token
   - Revoke access if possible
   - Create new credentials

2. **Report the incident**
   - Follow the vulnerability reporting process above
   - Include what was exposed and when

3. **Remove from history**
   - Use `scripts/clean_history.sh`
   - Follow force-push coordination process
   - See [CONTRIBUTING.md#force-push-coordination](CONTRIBUTING.md#force-push-coordination)

4. **Document the incident**
   - Create post-mortem
   - Update security policies
   - Improve detection/prevention
