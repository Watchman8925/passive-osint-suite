# 🔐 Security Remediation - Quick Reference

**Date**: 2025-10-15  
**Issue**: Committed Private Key (CRITICAL)  
**Status**: Code Changes Complete / History Cleanup Required

## 🚨 What Happened?

A private Ed25519 signing key was accidentally committed to the repository at `config/audit_ed25519_key.pem`. This key is used for cryptographic signatures on audit trail entries.

## ✅ What's Been Fixed?

1. **Removed from working directory** - Key file deleted
2. **Prevention added** - `.gitignore` updated to block future key commits
3. **Secure key management** - Code now supports environment variables
4. **Tools provided** - Utility script for generating new keys
5. **Documentation complete** - Comprehensive guides for all scenarios

## ⚠️ What Still Needs to Be Done?

### Critical (Admin Required)

**Remove key from git history** - The key is still in historical commits and must be removed by a repository administrator.

See: [`docs/GIT_HISTORY_CLEANUP.md`](docs/GIT_HISTORY_CLEANUP.md)

```bash
# Quick version (admin only):
git filter-repo --path config/audit_ed25519_key.pem --invert-paths
git push origin --force --all
```

## 🔑 Generate New Key

```bash
# Run the key generation script
python scripts/generate_audit_key.py

# Output will include:
# - Private key (base64-encoded for environment variable)
# - Public key (for distribution/verification)
```

## 🚀 Use New Key

### Development
```bash
# Add to .env file (never commit this file)
echo "AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY=<your_generated_key>" >> .env
```

### Production
```bash
# Store in secret manager
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
    --name osint-suite/audit-signing-key \
    --secret-string "<your_generated_key>"

# Set as environment variable in deployment
export AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY="<your_generated_key>"
```

## ✨ New Features

### Environment Variable Support

The audit trail now supports loading keys from environment variables (most secure):

```python
# Priority order:
# 1. AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY environment variable ← Most secure
# 2. File: logs/audit/audit_signing_key.pem
# 3. Generate new key automatically
```

### Key Generation Tool

```bash
# Generate new key pair
python scripts/generate_audit_key.py

# Options:
python scripts/generate_audit_key.py --help
python scripts/generate_audit_key.py --output-dir ./keys
```

## 🔒 Security Improvements

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ Key in repository | ✅ Key removed from working directory |
| ❌ Only file-based keys | ✅ Environment variable support (priority) |
| ❌ No generation tool | ✅ Dedicated key generator |
| ❌ Limited .gitignore | ✅ Comprehensive patterns (*.pem, *.key, etc.) |
| ❌ No documentation | ✅ Complete security guides |

## 🧪 Testing

All changes have been tested and verified:

```
✅ Environment variable key loading - PASSED
✅ File-based key fallback - PASSED
✅ Key generation utility - PASSED
✅ Signature creation - PASSED
✅ Signature verification - PASSED
✅ Existing audit trail tests - PASSED
✅ CodeQL security scan - PASSED (0 vulnerabilities)
```

## 🆘 Quick Help

### "How do I generate a new key?"
```bash
python scripts/generate_audit_key.py
```

### "How do I use the new key in development?"
```bash
# Add to .env file
echo "AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY=<key>" >> .env
```

### "How do I use the new key in production?"
Store in secret manager or set as environment variable. See [`docs/SECURE_KEY_MANAGEMENT.md`](docs/SECURE_KEY_MANAGEMENT.md)

### "How do I clean git history?"
See [`docs/GIT_HISTORY_CLEANUP.md`](docs/GIT_HISTORY_CLEANUP.md) (admin required)

### "Will this break my existing deployment?"
No! The code is backward compatible. If no environment variable is set, it will use file-based keys as before.

### "Do I need to update my code?"
No! The changes are transparent. Just set the environment variable if you want to use it.

## 📞 Support

1. **Documentation**: Check `docs/` directory for detailed guides
2. **Issues**: Open GitHub issue (DO NOT include private keys)
3. **Security**: Contact security team for urgent matters

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Never commit private keys** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
3. **Use secret managers** in production environments
4. **.gitignore is your friend** - configure it properly
5. **Rotate keys regularly** - establish a schedule
